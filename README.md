# Twitter-like
Pretty simple twitter-like application

This is a simple application where you can create a user and post on your or others wall.

You will have to enter valid IDs for the host, the root and their passwords according to your database manager setup (I used phpmyadmin). 
These variables are located in /setup.php and /includes/db-connect.php.

When the database is set up you can register with your test infos or connect directly to the test account 
to see the application working.

/process folder contains the logics for the data processing (forms -register, posts, comments...- and relationships - add friend, block user... -).
